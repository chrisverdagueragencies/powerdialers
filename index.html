                    <p><strong>What Works:</strong> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with Allstate. Quick question—when's the last time someone actually reviewed your coverage to make sure you're not overpaying?"</p>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> You asked a question that engages their brain instead of triggering auto-reject. You led with THEIR benefit, not your product.</p>

                <div class="week-item">
                    <h4>Week 2: Voice and Tone</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Pace: Slightly slower than normal (shows confidence)</li>
                        <li>Tone: Warm but professional</li>
                        <li>Energy: Calm and steady, not hyped up</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Speak like you're calling a neighbor with genuinely helpful information. You're not begging for business—you're offering something valuable.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The Key:</strong> Keep it brief (15-30 seconds MAX), then pivot: "Alright, let me get to why I called..."</p>

                    <h4>Week 4: Asking the Right Questions</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"What's your biggest concern when it comes to your current coverage?"</li>

Here's what I'd suggest: let me ask you a few quick questions to see if this is even worth both of you looking at. If it is, I can schedule a time for one of our specialists to call when you're both available. Sound good?"</p>

Here's the thing though: you haven't even gotten a quote yet, so you don't actually know what it'll cost. Our specialists are really good at finding discounts and bundles that most people don't know about. What if I connect you with someone who can give you real numbers in about 5 minutes?

                        <li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Don't grind for 3 hours straight. Take a 5-minute walk between call blocks</li>
                        <li><strong>Reframe rejection:</strong> If your transfer rate is 1 in 20, every "no" brings you closer to a "yes"</li>

                    <p><strong>1. Dials to Conversations Ratio</strong><br>
                    How many dials does it take to get someone on the phone? If it's too high, your list might be bad or your timing is off.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>2. Conversations to Qualified Leads Ratio</strong><br>
                    How many conversations turn into actual qualified transfers? If this is low, you're not asking the right questions or handling objections well.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>3. Qualified Leads to Transfers Ratio</strong><br>
                    How many qualified leads actually get transferred? If this is low, you're losing them at the finish line.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>4. Time of Day Performance</strong><br>
                    Are you more effective in the morning or afternoon? Do people answer more at certain times? Adjust your schedule accordingly.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>How to Use This Data:</strong> Review your numbers every week. If your dials-to-conversations ratio is low, work on your opening. If your conversations-to-qualified ratio is low, work on objection handling. If your qualified-to-transfer ratio is low, work on recognizing the right moment.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Identify your weakest link and fix it. One improvement in the right area can double your results.</p>
